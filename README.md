**The Debugger leverages the power of the ptrace system call to provide low-level process control and monitoring capabilities. ptrace enables the debugger to observe and manipulate the execution of a target process, facilitating real-time analysis, breakpoint management, and precise control over program execution. This system call serves as a fundamental building block for the debugger's advanced debugging features.**


* Real-time Analysis:

    * **Instruction execution, flow control, and memory interactions.**

* Breakpoint Management:

   * **Support for traditional breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and watchpoints.**
  
   * **Precise control over program execution with breakpoint manipulation.**

* Register and Memory Inspection:
  
  * **Examination of CPU registers and memory contents during runtime.** 
  
  * **Hexadecimal and ASCII representations for efficient data analysis.**

* Step-by-Step Execution Control:

  * **Fine-grained execution control with step into, step over, and step out functionalities.
